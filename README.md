## General info

A small project in react generated by ChatGPT (v 3.5 and 4) to check the ability of AI to generate code and handle errors. I haven't add anything to it so you can check the source code. If you are interested in reading the article I wrote about my thoughts on "AI vs programmers" [click here] ().

## Demo

Check the [demo here](https://stunning-malasada-1f8694.netlify.app/).

## Installation and running

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
